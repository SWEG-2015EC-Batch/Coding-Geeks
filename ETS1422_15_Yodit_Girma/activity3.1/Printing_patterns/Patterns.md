9#ABC rectangular pattern
Problem analysis
Input-no input.
Operation-using involves nested loops and character manipulation to display a grid of letters.
Output- a grid of letters in the shape of a rectangle.
Pseudocode
Step 1:start the program.
Step 2: Set length to 4 & the width to 6.
Step 3:Set currentLetter to 'A'.
Step 4: For i from 0 to length-1 and for j from 0 to width-1: -Output currentLetter followed by a space. - Increment currentLetter by 1.
Step 5: If currentLetter is greater than 'X' - Output a newline
Step 6: If currentLetter is greater than 'X': Exit the outer loop. Step 7:exit the program.
#abc Pattern
Problem analysis 
Input- no input. 
Operation- initializing an array o characters with values 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and then using nested loops to print the characters from the array in a 5x5 grid that are separated by spaces. 
Output- a 5x5 grid of characters separated by spaces with each row separated by a newline character.
pseudocode 
Step 1: Start. 
Step 2: Set rows = 5, columns = 5. 
Step 3: Initialize letters array with 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'. 
Step 4:For i = 0 to rows - 1 and for j = 0 to columns - 1, output letters j, " ", Output, newline character. 
Step 5: End

 #number pattern in rectangular form
Problem analysis 

Input-no input. 

Oppression- loop-based iteration to print a grid of numbers. 

Output- a grid of numbers sequentially printed in each row and separated by spaces in a visually structured format.

Pseudocode 

step 1: start the program. 
Step 2: set row=5 and row=5. 
Step 3: For i from 1 to rows and for j from 1 to columns, print j followed by a space 
Step 4:Output a newline 
step 5:end
#Hollow_pattern rectangular
Problem analysis 

Input- no input. 

operation- using nested loops to iterate through each cell of a 2D grid.

• print "" if the cell is on the border of the grid, and if it is not on the border, print " " (two spaces) 

Output- display a 2D grid pattern made of "" and spaces.

Pseudocode:

Step 1:start the program. 

Step 2: Set rows to 4 and columns to 6. 

Step 3: To print a new line For i from 1 to rows and for j from 1 to columns, - If i is equal to 1 or i is equal to rows or j is equal to 1 or j is equal to columns, then Print "* ". -Else print " " 

step 4: Exit

#Inverted full pyramid
Problem analysis 

Input-no input. 

Operation-using nested loops to generate a pattern of asterisks and spaces.

Output- a pattern of asterisks and spaces in the shape of an inverted pyramid.

Pseudocode 

Step 1: Start the program. 

Step 2: Set rows = 6. 

Step 3: To print a new line, for i = rows to 1 (decrementing by 1): - For space = 1 to (rows - i), print " ". - For j = 1 to (2 * i - 1), Print "* ".

Step 4: exit
