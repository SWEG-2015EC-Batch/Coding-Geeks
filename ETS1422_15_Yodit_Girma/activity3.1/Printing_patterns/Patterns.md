Problem analysis
Input-no input.
Operation-using involves nested loops and character manipulation to display a grid of letters.
Output- a grid of letters in the shape of a rectangle.
Pseudocode
Step 1:start the program.
Step 2: Set length to 4 & the width to 6.
Step 3:Set currentLetter to 'A'.
Step 4: For i from 0 to length-1 and for j from 0 to width-1: -Output currentLetter followed by a space. - Increment currentLetter by 1.
Step 5: If currentLetter is greater than 'X' - Output a newline
Step 6: If currentLetter is greater than 'X': Exit the outer loop. Step 7:exit the program.
Problem analysis 
Input- no input. 
Operation- initializing an array o characters with values 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and then using nested loops to print the characters from the array in a 5x5 grid that are separated by spaces. 
Output- a 5x5 grid of characters separated by spaces with each row separated by a newline character.
pseudocode 
Step 1: Start. 
Step 2: Set rows = 5, columns = 5. 
Step 3: Initialize letters array with 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'. 
Step 4:For i = 0 to rows - 1 and for j = 0 to columns - 1, output letters j, " ", Output, newline character. 
Step 5: End
 abc pattern
