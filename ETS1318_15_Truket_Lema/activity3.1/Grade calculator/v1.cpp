Certainly! Here's the modified program with the word "corresponding letter grade" changed to "student grade":

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int mark;
    cout << "Enter the mark of the course: ";
    cin >> mark;

    if (mark >= 90) {
        cout << "The student grade is A+" << endl;
    } else if (mark >= 80) {
        cout << "The student grade is A" << endl;
    } else if (mark >= 75) {
        cout << "The student grade is B+" << endl;
    } else if (mark >= 60) {
        cout << "The student grade is B" << endl;
    } else if (mark >= 55) {
        cout << "The student grade is C+" << endl;
    } else if (mark >= 45) {
        cout << "The student grade is C" << endl;
    } else if (mark >= 30) {
        cout << "The student grade is D" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The student grade is F" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
