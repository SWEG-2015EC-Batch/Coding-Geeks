problem analysis:
input: operator (+, -, *, /),number1 and number2
output:result
  
Algorithm in pseudocode:
1. Start the program.
2. Display a message to the user asking for the operator (+, -, *, /).
3. Read the operator from the user.
4. If the operator is '0', break the loop and exit the program.
5. Display a message to the user asking for the first number.
6. Read the first number from the user.
7. Display a message to the user asking for the second  number.
8. Read the second  number from the user.
9. Use a switch statement to determine the type of arithmetic operation.
10. If the operator is '+', add the number and display the result.
11. If the operator is '-', subtract the  number and display the result.
12. If the operator is '*', multiply the number and display the result.
13. If the operator is '/', divide the  number and display the result.
14. If the operator is invalid, display an error message.
15. Return to step 2.
