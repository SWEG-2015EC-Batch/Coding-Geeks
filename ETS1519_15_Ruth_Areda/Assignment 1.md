3.Uppercase/Lowercase Letter Convertor
Analysis:
	Input= = Letter
	Process = if islower(Letter) Letter = toupper(Letter) else if, is upper(Letter) Letter tolower(Letter) else Letter = is not a Letter
	Out put = 
          Algorithms:      
	Step 1: Start
	Step 2.:Declare a character variable 'letter'
	Step 3: Prompt the user to enter a letter
	Step 4:Read and store the input in the 'letter' variable
	Step 5:Check if the entered letter is in lower case using the islower() function from ctype.h
	Step 6:If the letter is in lower case, convert it to upper case using the toupper() function and display the uppercase equivalent
	Step 7: If the letter is in upper case using the isupper() function from ctype.h, convert it to lower case using the tolower() function and display the lowercase equivalent
	Step 8: If the entered character is not a letter, display "Invalid input"
	Step 9:End
